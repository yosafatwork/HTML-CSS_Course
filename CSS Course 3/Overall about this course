Overall what i learn on this course:


 - how to position thing
 - how to combine selector
 - how to understand about inheritance in css
 
 
 ps:
 - i cheated on positioning, especially in the test.
 - i cheated on positioning, because i am sleepy, and i feel shor circuited. i need to change my study time.
 - i cheated positioning because i don't pay attention.
- i pick a little bit of misunderstanding in inheritance because i make a little bit typo. i need to understand deeply about the task and pay attention to the keyword
