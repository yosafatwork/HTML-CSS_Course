Overall what i learn on this course:


 - how to add font and change font property
 - how to change color based on rgb or hex
 - how to being vreative in studying a box model
 
 
 ps:
 - i cheated on learning box model and font property
 - i cheated on font property because i dont see that if i want to add new font, i need to use "". i dont read even from the embedded code.
 - i cheated on box model, because i misread that the p tag need 0 margin
 - and i don't understand why i need to put border-width, why not a normal border? because what i understand is, border can have short-hand, like:
 border: 10px black solid.
- i watched again. apparently, border is simply for short-hand only. but border-width is something specific, to rule how big or small that border is.
