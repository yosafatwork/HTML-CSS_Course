Overall what i learn on this course:


 - how to position display
 - how to setup display so become fluid as the screen goes by
 
 
 ps:
 - i cheated on the test, because i lost focus and fell asleep.
 - i cheated on media query, because i fell asleep.
 - i cheated positioning because i don't pay attention.
 - i pick a little bit of misunderstanding in inheritance because i make a little bit typo. i need to understand deeply about the task and pay attention to the keyword
